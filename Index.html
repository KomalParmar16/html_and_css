                            <p>I’m so happy to have found Vidya Mantra! I joined ISKCON (Hare Krishna Movement) in 1974, and have been using Moodle since 2008…..mostly on my own, which meant I was very frustrated with both admin and teaching duties. Due to some difficulty with my own site and upgrades from Moodle 1 to 2, I searched for another Moddle host and found Vidya Mantra — the perfect fit for me.</p>
